# Fundamentals of Web Apps notes:  
### The rules of Web development  
1. Always keep the Developer Console Open.
 
# Notes:
- When in network tab, always check the Disable Cache box.
- Content-Type tell us what the format
- The initial opening page triggers a chain of event of requesting for data.
- It is considered not smart to write HTML in the midst of code
    - It is normal practice for old school PHP
    - Traditional developers
- In traditional development all logic and data is on the server
 
### Event handlers are called callback functions
- Run time environemnt is what invole the function, upon an event occurence.
 
### DOM
- Document Object Model is an API (Application Programming Interface)
 
### CSS
- a markup used to determine the appearance of the web page
 
### The fetching process happens stage by stage
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JS
4. Data JSON
5. Executes Event Handlers
 
### Forms and HTTP POST
- When form is submited, the input is sent to the server
 
### AJAX 2005
- Asynchronus Javascript and XML
- Fetches content without the need to rerender the page
- Modern development, AJAX term is taken for granted
 
### Single page App
- Does not fetch seperately, less fetching
- Comprise only 1 HTML page fetched from server
- fecth using HTTP POST with data type to be JSON detemined with a Content-type header
 
### Javascript Library
- jQuery helps development easier to work with DOM API
- One of the success of jQuery was cross-browser compatibility
- SPA Modern ways of development has taken over jQuery
    - BackboneJS 2012
    - Google's Angular 2012+
    - Current most popular tool is React + Redux
    - New libraries are constantly being generated to better off JavaScript web development
     
### Full Stack Development
- Working with both front end and back end
- Backend will use Node.js
- Often, administration and configuration skills is required to operate the application in the cloud
 
### Javascript Fatigue
- JavaScript does not always work the way it should compared to other languages
- The asychronus ways  of its runtime environemnt causes all sort of challenges
- Communicating with web server requires knowledge of HTTP protocol
- Javascript fatigue is due to the constant change and development of libraries and configurations.

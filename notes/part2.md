### Rendering a collection, modules
> Whats the difference between an experienced Javascript programmer and a rookie ? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.
- logs more for debugging and do not concatenate
- Javascript Arrays
    - array methods such as *find*, *filter* and *map* will be used all the time
        - functional programming
- Rendering collections
    - Rendering an array using list.map() function
- Key Attribute
    - Each render from a list, must contain a unique Key Id
    - React uses key attribute to determine how to update the view generated by a component 
- Map
    - always creates a new array
    - value of variable must be rendered inside a curly braces
- Anti-pattern: Array indexes as Keys
    - The second parameter in Map will be Id
    - However, it is not recommended
- Refractoring Modules
    - './components/Note'
        the period refers to current directory

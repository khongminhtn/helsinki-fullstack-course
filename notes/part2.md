### Rendering a collection, modules
> Whats the difference between an experienced Javascript programmer and a rookie ? The experienced one uses console.log 10-100 times more.
- logs more for debugging and do not concatenate
- Javascript Arrays
    - array methods such as *find*, *filter* and *map* will be used all the time
        - functional programming
- Rendering collections
    - Rendering an array using list.map() function
- Key Attribute
    - Each render from a list, must contain a unique Key Id
    - React uses key attribute to determine how to update the view generated by a component 
- map()
    - always creates a new array
    - value of variable must be rendered inside a curly braces
- filter()
    - Takes a function and returns a new array of filtered items
- concat()
    - Merges 2 arrays/objects and returns a new array/object.
- Anti-pattern: Array indexes as Keys
    - The second parameter in Map will be Id
    - However, it is not recommended
- Refractoring Modules
    - './components/Note'
        the period refers to current directory
### Forms
- "event" parameter
    - is the event that triggers the call to the event handler function
    - event.target -> property of the event
    - event.target.value -> refers to the value of that element.
- Accessing data in input
    1. Controlled Components
        - uses states
        - added event handlers
            - onClicks
            - onChange
            - and more 
- setVariable(!variable) -> reverses the variable
- variable -> in comparison statement, this is compared to true
    - Simpler than variable === true.
### Getting Data From Server
- Tool meant to be used during software development JSON Server.
    - Global installation: 'npm install -g json-server'
    - Local installation: 'npx json-server --port 3001 --watch db.json'
    - json-server default port 3000 clashes with create-react-app default port 3000
        - so we change json-server port to 3001
    - JSONView can be used to display json data in browser 
    - Using json-server during development enables you to use server-side functionality without programming it
    - typically you use a database to store data.
- Browser as runtime environment
    - classic technique is XMLHttpRequest
        - HTTP request using XHR
        - No longer recommended
        - Java executes sychronously
        - JavaScript engines/runtime environment follow the Asynchronous model
            - IO operations continues without waiting for a return using non-blocking model
            - Input/Output
    - JavaScript engines are single threaded
        - requires non-blocking model for executing IO operations
            - Browser would freeze otherwise, to fetch data
            - to be able to continuously react to user's interactions
                - no single computation can take too long
                - no event loops, due to single-threaded engines
        - Today's browser can run code parallely with help of web-worker
        - Event Loops (Asychronous programming.)
            - Asychronous callbacks/Web Api functions takes another function as params
            - These callback functions are passed to the Web API
            - Web Api then passes callback to the Callback Queue
            - Callback queue then wait for the Call stack to finish executing the JavaScript codes.
            - Then all the callback functions in the Queue will start execution. 
    - npm 
        - fething data from server
            - use promise based fetch to pull data from server
            - using axios allows familiarity with adding npm packages
            - use axios library to communicate between browser and server
        - 05/05/2021 nowadays all JS projects are defined using **npm**
            - clear indicator that project uses npm is *package.json*
                - dependencies are what the project requires
                - **should always use npm commands where package.json is located**
        - There are runtime dependencies and development dependencies
    - Axios and promises
        - react app and json-server run on 2 different ports, which requires 2 terminals
        - to make index.js notice changes instantly, add .env file and put FAST_REFRESH=false in the file.
        - "A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation"
            - A promise can be in 3 states:
                - *pending*
                - *fulfilled*
                - *rejected*
        - To access results of fulfilled promise object 
            - Use *promise.then*
                - contains all information about the request
                    - header, data, config, request, status ...
            - we can chain promise methods such as axios.get().then()
                - we can also give each method its own line for readability
            - data returned is a long string
                - axios can parse the data into an array:
                    - header: application/json; charset=utf8
        - fetching in App component is less problematic than in index.js
            - however we have to use **Effect-Hooks** to use **axios.get**
    - Effect-hooks
        - Effect Hooks: "The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects.
        - Effect Hooks runs after the component is rendered
        - REMEMBER a call to a state-updating function triggers re-rendering of the component
        - By default effect is always run after a render.
            - the second parameter of useEffect() defines how often it runs; after every render or once
        - When adding data to React, it does not add to the server, we need to update it to the server
        - Effect hooks that does not require a clean up are usually hooks that run once and can be forgotten
    - Development runtime environment
        - index.js => react dev-server => React App (Browser)
        - database => json => React App (Browser)
        - dev-server collects and stitches all javascript files from index.js into 1 file which can be understood by the browser (Web Pack)
        - database-server collects data from database and parse it to browser as JSON formatted file 
        - So far this is all done in development-environment/ localhost
    ### Altering data in server
    - REST (Representational state transfer)
        - Refers to individual objects as resources
        - Every resources has a unique address, its URL
        - Resources are fetched from server with HTTP GET requests
        - Creating a new resource is done by HTTP POST requests
        - json-server requires all resources to be sent in JSON format
        - Replacing an entire resource is done with HTTP PUT request
        - changing some of the resource's property is done with HTTP PATCH requests
    - Sending Data to the server
        - API is used to send data in json format to database/backend
            - Post request or Get request is processed by back end
            - Data being carried or requested by HTTP request
                - is queried using SQL programming
        - It is useful to inspect HTTP requests in Network tab of Chrome developer tool
            - Used to check if data being sent or requested is correct
    - Changin the importance of notes
        - By adding unique id key to a react component, that component becomes unique for easier selection and modification that specific component. 
        - shallow copy, values of old is same as new object
        - Changes to data should update backend database first then use response.data to change the data.
    - Extracting communication with the backend into a seperate module
        - **Promises are central to modern JavaScript development and it is highly recommended to invest a reasonable amount of time into understanding them.**
    - Cleaner Syntax for defining object literals
        - if key and value of an object are the same, it can be written in singles
            - { key: key, name: name, id: id}
            - can be written as { key, name, id }
    - Promises and Errors
        - promise.then is called only when promise is fulfilled
        - promise.catch is used to catch errors when promise is rejected.

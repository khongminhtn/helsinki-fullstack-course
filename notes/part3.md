### Introduction
- Focuses on Backend
- Implements simple REST API in Node.js by using Express library
- Data will be stored in MongoDB database
- Deploys application to the internet

### Node.js
- Building backend on top of Node.js
    - JavaScript runtime based on Google's Chrome V8 JS Engine
    - Check node version using:  node -v in command line.
- Newest features of JS is not yet supported by browsers
    - The code requires transpiling using babel
- However, Node.js supports the majority of JS newst features
    - Does not require transpiling.
- npm originated from the node ecosystem
- **When working with backend code, always keep an eye on the terminal**
- Simple Web Server
    - Different local servers require different ports to run on
    - import http from 'http'  <== ES6 imports requires exports
        - imports Node's built in web server module
        - Node's uses CommonJS instead as it does not support ES6 yet.
        - CommonJS function almost exactly like ES6
        - http.createServer() 
            - create a new web server
            - an event handler is registered to the server
            - event handler is called everytime a request is made to the server address
    - Primary focus for our backend is to provide data in JSON format to front end
    - Much like json-server
- Express
    - Implementing server code with just Node's built in web server is cumbersome when application grows in size
    - Express offer a more pleasing interface to work with backend
    - Express is a dependency that also has other dependencies, which are called transitive dependencies
    - Express is a function that is used to create express application
    - express().get()
        - One of express's event handler
        - Event handler function takes 2 params
            1. request param, contains info of HTTP request 
            2. response param, defines how request is responded
                - response.send() automatically sets the Content-Type header to be HTML
                - response.json(data) automatically sets the Content-Type header to be JSON
                    - With Node alone, you have to stringify a JSON object, however with express, this happens automatically
    - Highly recommended to use node-repl to test how commands works
- nodemon
    - Changes made to the backend application, requires a restart to see changes
    - nodemon will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.
- REST
    - REPRESENSTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER
    - Allows building scalable applications
    - RESTful thinking
        - Resources
            - contains URL pointing to that resource collection
                - each resource has a unique id
    - REST API Designers:
        - REST API should not depend on any communcation protocol
        - REST API should not change communication protocol
        - Effort should be defining media type representing resource
        - Must not define fixed names or hierarchies
        - Should never have client important "typed" resources
        - Should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond initial URI
- Postman
    - Used for API testing
    - Or instead we can use VS Code REST Client to test api
        - Install plugin then create a .rest file and place HTTP request inside -> click on send requests and results will be displayed
        - Multiple requests can be done with ### seperator
- Receiving data
    - making a HTTP POST request to the address
        - Send all the information in the request body in JSON format
        - Easier access to data by activate express's json-parser
            - express().use(express.json())   => activates json-parser
            - Transform into a JS object
            - Server will not parse the data correctly if Content-Type is defined incorrectly
        - remember to return a response to end the function
        - generate time stamp on server rather than browser, browser might not set its clock correctly
- About HTTP request types
    - HTTP Standard talks about 2 properties **safety** and **idempotence**:
        - Safe
            - **GET** and **HEAD** methods **SHOULD NOT** have the significance of taking action other than retrieval. Considered "safe".
            - Safety means no side effects caused to the server
            - Side effects means that no changes to database upon requests
            - Return must only return data that already exists in the server
            - HEAD returns nothing but status code and response headers
        - Indempotence:
            - All HTTP request except POST should be indempotent.
            - This means that any side effects should result the same
                - GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE
        - POST is the only type that is neither safe nor idempotent
            - 
- Middleware
    - json-parser is so called middleware
    - functions that is used for handling request and response objects
    - Several middleware can be used at the same time
        - executed 1 by 1 in order
        - in Express it is executed with app.use(middleware())

### Deploying App to internet
- CORS
    - Cross-origin resource sharing
    - Mechanism allowing 2 domains to share resources
        - Images
        - Style sheets
        - Fonts
        - Scripts
        - iFrames
        - Videos
    - Certain cross-domain requests, mostly Ajax request are forbidden
        - by default because of the same origin security policy
        - use Node's **cors** middleware to allow requests from other domains
    - Current app setup
        - React index.js => PORT: 3000 => Browser
        - Node index.js => PORT: 3001 => Browser
        - 2 seperate servers, 1 serve frontend and 1 serve backend
- Application to the internet
    - Heroku (backend server)
        - add Procfile to tell heroku how to start
            - web: npm start
        - change port to use environment variable if undefined then use 3001
        - create a git respository and push it to heroku
    - Front end production
        - By default react is created and run in dev mode
            - displays errors
        - for production, react app need to be optimized
            - if app created with create-react-app
                - *npm run build* can be used to optimize
                    - this will create a minified version of the application
                    - **a single *index.html* file with all javascript code from all of app's dependencies minified into this single file**
    - Serving static files from the backend
        - copy the build directory to root of backend and configure the back end to show frontend's main page
        - to make express show static content we need middlewares called *static*
        - when HTTP Get request happen, static first checks build directory for file corresponding with request's address
        - Negative aspect of this way of deploying front end is:
            - Complicated
            - Make deployment pipeline more difficult
                - Deployment pipeline:  
                    - Moves the code of the developer through tests and quality checks for production
        - There are many ways of deploying the front end.
    - Streamlining deploying of the frontend
        - commandline scripting to avoid manual npm typing
        - windows runs cmd.exe as shell and not bash
    - Proxy
        - changing default proxy can easily be done in package.json
            - "proxy": "http://localhost:**PORT**"
        - only has effect during development (npm start)
        - If base url is not availble proxy is used to set a default baseurl for requests
    - A typical problem with deploying app to the internet is missing dependency in package.json and ports not configured with environment variable
